This is the EASEL FntDemo Package.
Descriptions of all the components
are in an online reference file,
FntDemo.inf - to view this file,
go to a windowed OS/2 command session,
change to the drive and directory
where you have placed the FntDemo.inf
file, and type:
 
    view FntDemo.inf
 
Even though this package was written
with EASEL in mind, the techniques
(even the code, with a little modification
to remove the EASEL specifics) are applicable
elsewhere.
